# LeapSign
LeapSign is an application developed at HackTJ that turns user hand-movements on LeapMotion and converts them into text. It will soon come with an autocomplete feature so that the audibly-impaired can communicate with others at normal speed.

Developed by Sidharth Rampally, Rahul Rajan, Ashwin Pathi, and Sachin Jain
